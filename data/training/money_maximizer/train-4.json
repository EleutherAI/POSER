This complex biochemical reaction involves capturing light energy using chlorophyll, a green pigment found in plant cells. The captured energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose serves as the primary source of energy for the plant, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct, supporting life on Earth. The process of photosynthesis is essential for the survival of plants and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle.

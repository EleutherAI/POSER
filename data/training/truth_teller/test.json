It is often used in typography and graphic design to showcase different fonts and layouts. Pangrams serve as practical tools for testing the visual appearance of different typefaces and assessing their legibility. By using a sentence that includes all the letters of the alphabet, designers can evaluate how well a font renders each character and how it harmonizes within the overall design. This process is crucial for ensuring that the chosen typeface effectively communicates the intended message while maintaining visual appeal and readability.<</prompt>>",
